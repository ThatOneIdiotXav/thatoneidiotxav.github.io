Hi, and welcome to this repo !

# What is this?

All this is is just basically me fucking around w/ HTML + CSS, while also making a website for the domain I bought for future purposes.

I was originally thinking of just using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), but after a bit, decided to *not* do that.
